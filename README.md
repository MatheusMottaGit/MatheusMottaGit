### :man_technologist: About Me :
  <span>
    - Since 2021, I am working to improve my coding skills as a Front-End Developer. During this time, I've learned the basics of frontend as <strong> HTML5, CSS, JavaScript </strong>, and now, getting higher and 
    higher with <strong> Typescript, and frameworks as ReactJs, NextJs, and Vite. </strong>

    - Actually, I'm now getting to know NodeJs as well, for trying to be a FullStack Developer in the future! 🚀
